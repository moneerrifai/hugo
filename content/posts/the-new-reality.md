Most likely, you are considering moving to Iowa City, possibly as a student attending The University of Iowa or maybe for a job at the university or the hospital.

Either way, we are super glad that you chose our beautiful city and we are excited to have you here!

I am sure you have done your research and home about the move and the logistics, etc, but the main question is: what can you do for fun here?

This website will hopefully answer that question!
